I worked on a payroll tracker program using C++ that utilizes an Object-Oriented Design to capture and display payroll information about employees.

To use and interact with this program, feel free to download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, either double-click on the "WageObjects.exe" file, or you can go to the command prompt in terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory, and run the .exe file by entering the following command: 

WageObjects.exe

The program will then start, and after following the simple prompt directions, the program will also place the output into terminal.

During this project, I learned more about C++ preprocessor commands, Class syntax, public and private access modifiers, getter functions, prototypes, how classes create blueprints for creating objects, the scope resolution operator,  constructors and destructors, and overall C++ syntax.
